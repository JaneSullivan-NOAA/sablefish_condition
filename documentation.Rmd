Queries for survey and fishery data were run October 15, 2020

## Longline survey data

Specimen-level biological data from the NMFS Cooperative Longline Survey were queried from the `longline` SQL server database using the `Age_View` and detailed survey station information from the `Stations_View_AKFIN`. Prior to analysis, we removed specimens with missing length, weight, or maturity information, and removed potentially erroneous data using the the `error_flag` field, which includes a built-in check for outlying residuals from the established sablefish length-weight relationship. We only used biological data from the GOA, which corresponds to legs 2-7 and stations 62-149 of the survey (Siwicke et al. 2020). Data from slope and cross gully stations were included in the analysis. The resulting data set included specimens from 1996 to 2020. Maturity status for females was determined using database maturity codes 1 and 2 for immature fish and 3-6 for mature fish.

## Fishery data

Fishery-dependent specimen data collected from observers were queried from the `AKFIN` database's `NORPAC.DEBRIEFED_AGE` table using sablefish species code '203'. The original data set included multiple gear types; however, only specimens collected from longline gear code '8' were used. Maturity data for sablefish were very sparse and could not used for subsequent analyses. The earliest samples dated back to 1988; however, only samples from 1999-2020 were retained due to small sample sizes in earlier years. Other than these filters, we did not rigorously check for data quality or consistency in sampling strategies but contacted the Fishery Monitoring and Analysis (FMA) division for guidance on how best to utilize these data in future years. Separate indicators were developed for the GOA and BSAI regions.

## Overview of methods

We used the open source `akfishcondition` R library version developed by Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) / Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) analysts at the Alaska Fishery Science Center (Rohan 2020). Queries and code to reproduce the sablefish condition analysis are found at https://github.com/JaneSullivan-NOAA/sablefish_condition. Methods are consistent with analyses used by RACE/GAP to develop groundfish condition indicators for the GOA, EBS, and AI trawl surveys in 2020. However, unlike the methods used for RACE/GAP groundfish indicators, we assumed a single stratum for each group, and therefore did not weight length-weight residuals by stratum-specific area biomass or corresponding relative population numbers or weight (RPN/RPW). Although this development may be of interest, sample sizes for indicator groups were frequently too low to stratify, especially in the survey data. 

## 2020 sablefish condition indicators

We recommend the following sablefish condition indicators for inclusion in the Ecosystem Socioeconomic Profile (ESP): 

(1) GOA LL Survey: Age-4 immature females 
(2) GOA LL Survey: Large females >= 75 cm 
(3) GOA LL Fishery: Large females >= 75 cm 
(4) BSAI LL Fishery: Large females >= 75 cm 

The same indicators were used in the 2019 ESP (Hanselman et al. 2019, Appendix 3C). A previously used indicator that combined all juvenile females was removed because it included multiple year classes and was therefore difficult to interpret. Age-4 was selected to represent younger, immature female sablefish because they are well-represented in the survey compared to ages 2 or 3. Large mature females were represented by $\geq$ 75 cm in the longline survey in the GOA and in longline fisheries in the GOA and BSAI. 

```{r indicator_fig, include = TRUE, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("results/2020/recommended_sable_condition_2020.png") 
```

Estimated length-weight residuals with standard errors and sample sizes for each indicator group are reported below. Note that residuals were not estimated or reported for BSAI longline fishery females $\geq$ 75 cm after 2016 due to low sample sizes (n<10 were removed from the analysis).

```{r indicator_results, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
res <- read_csv("results/2020/recommended_sable_condition_indicators_2020.csv")

res <- res %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(mean_wt_resid), list(~ formatC(., format = "f", digits = 2, drop0trailing = FALSE))) %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(se_wt_resid), list(~ formatC(., format = "f", digits = 3, drop0trailing = FALSE))) %>% 
    mutate(indicator = factor(indicator, 
                              levels = c("GOA LL Survey: Age-4 immature females",
                                         "GOA LL Survey: Large females >= 75 cm",
                                         "GOA LL Fishery: Large females >= 75 cm",
                                         "BSAI LL Fishery: Large females >= 75 cm"),
                              ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(indicator, year)

names(res) <- c("Indicator", "Year", "n", "Residual", "SE")

```

```{r indicator_tbl, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

kable(res, align = "llrrr")
```

## Future development

We recommend the survey data be evaluated for seasonal and spatial trends in length-weight. We recommend a consultation with FMA to ensure the fishery data were consistently sampled over time. Finally, we recommend an examination of the serial residual patterns in the $\geq$ 75 cm indicators.
